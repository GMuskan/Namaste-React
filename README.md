# // JSX - (transpiled before it reaches the JS) - Parcel - Babel
# // JSX => Babel transpiles it to React.createElement => ReactElement(JS Object) => HTMLElement(render)

# config driven UI - website driven by data(like for swiggy app restaurant cards will be different based on location.)

# React Hooks
    -useState()
    -useEffect()
        if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render
        if empty dependency array => useEffect is called on initial render(just once)
        if dependency array is not empty => useEffect is called whenever dependencies changes

# 2 types of routing in web app

    - Build our store
    - Connect our store to our app
    - Create slice

    - Selector

# Types of Testing
    - Unit Testing
    - Integration Testing
    - End to End Testing (e2e)

# Setting up testing
    - Install react testing library
    - install jest
    - install babel dependicies for using jest
    - configure babel in babel.config.js file (this babel configuration for testing will be conflicted with parcel's babel configuration so to make our new babel configuration work(to disable default babel transpilation) we need to modify parcel configuration in .parcelrc)
    - jest configuration by npm jest --init
    - install jsdom library
    - install @babel/preset-react - to make JSX work in test cases
    - Include @babel/preset-react inside babel config
    - install @testing-library/jest-dom
